## Replication 

http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/replication.html

> Each replication request is assigned a session_id, which is just a UUID; you can also talk about a replication session identified by this ID.

> The next bit is the replication history. CouchDB maintains a list of history sessions for future reference. The history array is currently capped at 50 entries.

### Continuous Replications

http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/replication.html#continuous
At the time of writing, CouchDB doesnâ€™t remember continuous replications over a server restart.
